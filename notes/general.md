# General overview


OOP is a programming paradigm based on... well, `Objects`. An object represents an entity, phisical or conceptual, of the real world. An object has a `state` and a `behaviour`. To work with `objects` we create `ideals` of these objects named `Classes`, classes have an `internal characteristics`, represented by `Properties` and a `behaviour` represented by `Methods`. You could think of `classes` as `native data types` on steroids.
